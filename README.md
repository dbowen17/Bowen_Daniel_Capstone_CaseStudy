Hello I'm Daniel Bowen and this is my Capstone Project. I am testing the ecommerce website alexandnova.com. Some issues I ran into was having each test run in separate browsers, which was remedied by utilizing @BeforeMethod instead of @BeforeTest. Also another problem was ensuring the html reports were reflected correctly in Jenkins. This issue was resolve by placing " System.setProperty("hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP", "sandbox; img-src 'self';")  " in the script console of my node in Jenkins.
